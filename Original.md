TEST TASK FOR A SIMPLE BACKEND

    Write a Node.js application that uses the Express.js framework in order to expose an HTTP API.
    The application should read a `config.json` file to load the application settings (e.g.: the HTTP port to use).
    The application should also generate logs to STDOUT.

    HTTP API TO EXPOSE:

        The application will expose a single HTTP path `/api`, to which the application will listen for POST requests.

        REQUEST FORMAT:
            Each request's body should be of type `application/json` and should contain at least one property, i.e. `fn`.
            JSON property `fn` is a string that contains the name of the function that the client has requested to the application.
            Some functions also require parameters, that are specified in the `params` object property of the request's body.

        RESPONSE FORMAT:
            Each response given by the application has an HTTP status of 200 and is a JSON object that contains two properties:
                `ok`: is a boolean and is equal to `true` in case the HTTP request went well (no errors happened);
                `result`: is an object that contains the result of the HTTP request (in case no erros happened); in case of errors, `result` is `null`.
                
        FUNCTIONS IMPLEMENTED BY THE APPLICATION:
            `ping`:
                parameters: none
                response result: always `null`
                description: empty response with `ok` equal to `true`, used to check if application is running
            `getVersion`:
                parameters: none
                response result: always "1.0"
            `getUnixTimestamp`:
                parameters: none
                response result: a number equal to the current UNIX timestamp (i.e.: number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00:00 UTC)
            `changeOsTimezone`:
                parameters:
                    `timezone`: string with the IANA timezone name (e.g.: "Europe/London", "Asia/Manila", ...)
                response result: always `null`
                description: this API request will make the application change the Linux system's current timezone
            `getOsTimezone`:
                parameters: none
                response result: a string that contains the Linux system's current timezone

    CONFIG.JSON:
        The `config.json` is a file located in the same path of the application's executable.
        This file is a JSON object that contains two properties:
            `httpPort`: is a number that specifies which TCP port the application should listen to;
            `verbose`: is a boolean used to specify if the application should log about API activity and detailed error traces (see also the LOGGING section).

        NOTE: the file is expected to be read once during application startup, therefore it is not requested any "settings reload"
        feature: if someone modifies the `config.json` file, the application must be restarted in order to apply the new settings.
    
    LOGGING:

        The application will log using STDOUT in a simple textual format (that is decided by the candidate).
        Logging should be used to inform about the state of the application (e.g.: started, listening, ...)
        and to inform about possible errors (e.g.: cannot listen on the specified port, invalid config.json file, ...).
        JavaScript errors (with full error traces) should not be logged (unless in verbose mode, as explained below);
        instead of the full traces, JavaScript errors will be logged as generic "unexpected/unknown error" messages.

        VERBOSE MODE:
            If `verbose` property of `config.json` file is set to `true`, then the application will also log about
            API activity (i.e.: when the application receives an API request, it will also log about this event and
            the eventual outcome of the request) and will also log full JavaScript error traces instead of generic error messages.

    ENVIRONMENT:

        The environment that will be used to execute the application is:
            Node.js 16 LTS
            Linux x64 (Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Debian 10/11, RHEL/AlmaLinux 8, openSUSE/SLES 15)
            root permissions (either directly or using sudo)

    Any information and/or detail that is not specified in this task is left to the candidate (for instance: the exact format and text of the logs generated by the application).
